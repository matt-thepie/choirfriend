# choirfriend

A self-hosted, open-source web app for choirs. It does what Choirmate does — sheet music with annotations, learning tracks, piano for notebashing — without the per-seat licence fees. Bring your own auth provider.

## What it does

- PDF viewer for sheet music with two annotation layers: per-user private notes and a shared layer the whole choir can edit.
- Repeat / coda / D.S. markers you can drop on the score, and a "follow" mode that jumps between them.
- Learning tracks (audio) attached to each piece, with tempo slowdown that preserves pitch.
- A piano widget for notebashing.
- Pieces bundle PDFs + tracks + notes together; auth + roles come from a pluggable identity provider.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|------:|--------|-----|
| Server | Fastify 5 on Node 24 LTS | Plugin model + zero build step (Node 24's native TS stripping is stable as of 24.12) |
| Client | Vite 8 + React 19 + TypeScript | Vite handles client bundling; the backend stays compile-free |
| Styling | Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui | New `@theme` directive, OKLCH colours, `tw-animate-css` |
| DB | SQLite via `node:sqlite` (WAL mode) | No daemon, file-based, rsync to back up. Same choice as sgmc-identity. |
| Storage | Backblaze B2 behind a custom domain | Cheap, direct browser uploads via presigned URLs |
| Auth | Pluggable providers | sgmc-identity ships built in; generic OIDC is stubbed for other deployments |
| PDF rendering | PDF.js | Mature, free |
| Audio | Web Audio API + Tone.js | Tempo slowdown without pitch shift; Tone.js for the piano |

The original app was scaffolded against the SGMC choir's existing identity service. The auth layer is designed so other choirs can plug in Google, Microsoft, Keycloak, magic links, etc. without touching choirfriend itself.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24.12.0 or later.** We rely on stable native TypeScript stripping, which became stable in 24.12.0. With it, the server runs `.ts` files directly (`node src/server.ts`) — no `tsc`, no `tsx`, no build step. The SQLite module is also stable here.
- That's it. No Docker, no Postgres, no extra services.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matt-thepie/choirfriend.git
cd choirfriend
cp .env.example .env            # adjust any values you need

# Server (port 3001)
cd server
npm install
npm run dev

# Client (port 5173) — separate terminal
cd ../client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>. The client calls `/api/health` on the server and shows the result. SQLite creates `server/data/choirfriend.db` on first run (gitignored).

## Auth providers

Each provider is a file under `server/src/auth/providers/` implementing the `AuthProvider` interface in `types.ts`. Two shapes are supported:

1. **Cookie-trusting** — an external identity service has already set a cross-domain cookie. The provider verifies that cookie and returns a user. sgmc-identity works this way.
2. **OIDC-style** — redirect to issuer, get a code at `/auth/<name>/callback`, exchange for tokens, set our own session cookie. The generic OIDC provider is the stub for this.

To add a provider:

1. Drop a file in `server/src/auth/providers/`.
2. Implement `buildLoginUrl`, `identifyUser`, and (for OIDC-style) `handleCallback`.
3. Register it in `server/src/auth/index.ts` behind an `AUTH_<NAME>_ENABLED` env var.

### sgmc-identity setup

For SGMC's deployment specifically:

- Choirfriend will live at `music.sgmc.org.uk`. sgmc-identity's allowed-redirect regex already matches `*.sgmc.org.uk` — nothing to change on the identity side.
- The `sgmc_token` cookie is set with `domain: .sgmc.org.uk`, so it travels to `music.sgmc.org.uk` automatically.
- In production, set `AUTH_SGMC_IDENTITY_VERIFY_URL=http://localhost:3050/verify` so /verify calls stay on localhost.
- In dev, the cookie won't cross `localhost:3050 → localhost:3001`. Either run both behind `/etc/hosts` aliases like `identity.localtest.me` + `music.localtest.me` with the cookie scoped to `.localtest.me`, or test authenticated flows against the live identity service.

## Deployment

The server has no build step. On the VPS, GitHub Actions runs:

```bash
git pull
cd server && npm ci --omit=dev
cd ../client && npm ci && npm run build
pm2 restart choirfriend
```

The Fastify server serves `client/dist/` as static assets in production. nginx fronts everything and handles TLS.

## Open design questions

- **Annotation sync model:** push-on-save, or CRDT for offline-friendly merging?
- **Offline support:** service worker + IndexedDB caching of opened pieces is on the roadmap, not built yet.
- **Mobile:** the UI must be tablet/phone-first since most choristers use those at rehearsals.

## Status

Skeleton scaffold. Auth wired to sgmc-identity. PDF viewer, annotations, learning tracks, and the piano are not implemented yet — they're up next.
